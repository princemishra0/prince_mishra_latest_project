                    <li><b>Data Provisioning</b></li>
                    <p>Data as a Service (DaaS) providers offer access to a diverse range of datasets, often sourced
                        from various channels such as public databases, proprietary sources, or data aggregators.<br>
                        This
                        addresses specific data needs that may be challenging to fulfill independently.<br> Businesses
                        mostly lack the tools, expertise, or direct access to required data, DaaS providers streamline
                        the process.<br>

                        These services eliminate the complexities of permissions and data collection, allowing
                        businesses to focus on deriving insights and value from the acquired datasets.</p><br><br>

                    <li><b>Data Management</b></li>
                    <p>Data as a Service companies excel in managing data by handling the storage, organization, and
                    maintenance of large datasets.<br>Beyond these fundamental aspects, they navigate the complex landscape
                    of data permissions, ensuring compliance with regulations and addressing the nuances of data access
                    rights.<br> This includes securing necessary permissions and managing data in a way that aligns with
                    legal requirements<br>

                    DaaS platform also handles the data security risks of sensitive data in a more efficient way.</p><br><br>

                    <li><b>Data Analytics</b></li>
                    <p>Some DaaS providers offer data analytical tools and services, allowing users to derive insights from
                    the organization’s data they access. This may include tools for business intelligence, predictive
                    analytics, and machine learning.</p><br><br>

                    <li><b>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</b></li>
                    <p>Data as a Service companies often provide APIs that allow users to integrate the business data
                    directly into their applications, workflows, or systems.<br> This functionality empowers businesses to
                    harmonize their existing processes with the wealth of data offered by DaaS providers, fostering
                    enhanced operational efficiency, real-time insights, and increased adaptability to evolving business
                    needs.</p><br><br>

                    <li><b>Scalability</b></li>
                   <p> DaaS are scalable, meaning users can adjust their data usage based on their evolving needs. <br>This
                    flexibility is particularly beneficial for businesses with changing data requirements.<br> Moreover,
                    unlike other data collection methods such as web scraping tools, DaaS eliminates the need for a
                    dedicated IT team to manage the process of obtaining the required data.<br>

                    These services save time and effort by providing the need of the business, and also enhance
                    decision-making accuracy and efficiency for businesses by providing timely data.</p><br><br>

                    <li><b>Subscription-Based Model</b></li>
                    <p>DaaS is typically offered through a subscription-based model, allowing users to pay for the data
                    services they use.<br> Businesses may negotiate with DaaS provider for the data that fits their needs,
                    rather than investing in and maintaining their own data infrastructure.<br> This enables users to pay
                    only for the specific data services they utilize and offers cost savings.</p><br><br>
